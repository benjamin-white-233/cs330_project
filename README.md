## How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by first identifying the how the idea may be translated into separate classes.  This allows for easily modifiable code that can be easily maintained.  Overall, this project helped me fine tune my object-orientated programming, and I think the resulting code is a testiment to my skills in OOP developing.

## How do I approach developing programs?

Iteration was key to the development of this program.  Throughout the course, by implementing new features and abstracting logic into classes, I was able to build upon the previous week's work with ease.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

The skills that I have gained in the course will allow me to improve my programs by developing interactive GUIs.  Additionally, the troubleshooting that had to be done to get the course-provided code to run on Mac was a very beneficial, if not frustrating at times, experience.
